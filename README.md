# SquarerSeven
An A.I developed by SquarerFive

--------------------------------------
An A.I which is multiplatform.
To setup you will need:
1. Common Sense (etc: experience with Discord Bots and python.)
2. Python 3.6 with the following installed:
Install these in CMD:
```
pip install discord
pip install requests
pip install asyncio
pip install apiai
pip install simplejson
```
   
   
Once done, edit the client run code to your discord API code.
The AI is hosted on Google so it will be updated live when I edit it.
Just do not share this with too many people otherwise the AI may crash due to the requests.
# Live Update
It happens automatically. It will not restart or crash the bot.

# NOTE:
Everything is seen in Google Console, it is logged to improve the AI respond to more words. Please do not enter any private information even I don't steal, I prefer the users not to take the risk of entering their passwords or emails, if my account got hacked - the hacker would have access to all your information (though it is likely not to happen). I am not responsible if the API gets hacked.
# Version: 1.0
No changes... just launch.
