# SquarerSeven
An A.I developed by SquarerFive

--------------------------------------
An A.I which is multiplatform.
To setup you will need:
1. Common Sense (etc: experience with Discord Bots and python.)
2. Python 3.6 with the following installed:
Install these in CMD:
```
pip install discord
pip install requests
pip install asyncio
pip install apiai
pip install simplejson
```
   
   
Once done, edit the client run code to your discord API code.
The AI is hosted on Google so it will be updated live when I edit it.

# Version: 1.0
No changes... just launch.
